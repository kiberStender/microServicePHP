Based on the Micro Service rules you have to divide to conquer. Sounds like a clich√© expression considering all modern concepts says the same, but the difference here may rely on its 'required' divisions. According to Micro Service concept you must have two services for database transactions, one for writing actions and another one for reading actions. Another part of this concept is the idea that you must have a router service. Such service is designed to register services dinamically so you will not have to know where these services are hosted neither if it is a VM or a physical machine (making it easier to scale vertical and horizontally) and request the response of this services. So all you have to do is call router sending the service name you want to request, the data you want to be processed and wait for it's response. This summed up with a front end service (it might be a HTML application or even a mobile application) is the most basic structure you'll need in a simple Micro Service application.
